Release notes (changes from v19.12)
-----------------------------------

 - Major security and quality improvements:
   - PcapPlusPlus was added to [Google OSS-Fuzz](https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/) which uses the [Fuzz testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) technique to discover security vulnerabilities and stability bugs (thank you @zlowram !)
   - Created a new regression test suite for OSS-Fuzz bugfixes under [`Tests/Fuzzers/RegressionTests`](https://github.com/seladb/PcapPlusPlus/tree/master/Tests/Fuzzers/RegressionTests) (thank you @zlowram !)
   - Added [LGTM](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/seladb/PcapPlusPlus) integration to enable continuous code analysis and prevent critical vulnerabilities (thank you @alexey-tereshenkov-oxb !)
   - More than 60 issues were found by OSS-Fuzz and LGTM and fixed in this release
   - Revamped Packet++Test and Pcap++Test: tests are now more structured, divided into multiple files and use common and more intuitive test infrastructure
   - Added a new test suite (written in Python) to [PcapPlusPlus examples](https://github.com/seladb/PcapPlusPlus/tree/master/Examples) under [`Tests/ExamplesTests`](https://github.com/seladb/PcapPlusPlus/tree/master/Tests/ExamplesTest)
 - Added [Npcap](https://nmap.org/npcap/) support for Windows (in addition to legacy WinPcap support)

   - MacOS Catalina (10.15)
   - Ubuntu 20.04
 - New supported protocols:
   - BGP v4
   - IEEE 802.3 Ethernet
 - Performance optimization, readability improvements and code cleanup in various parts of the code (thank you @maruu and @gx740 !)
 - A complete rewrite of the IP address classes `IPv4Address`, `IPv6Address` and `IPAddress` to make them more efficient and easier to use (thank you @gx740 !)
 - In addition, new features were added to IP address classes:
   - Added "less than" comparison operator (thank you @maruu !)
   - Added subnet match for `IPv6Address` (thank you @DinoStray !)
 - Integrated streaming ZStd compression for pcapng files (thank you @Dysl3xik !)
 - Pcap/pcapng files:
   - Read and write in nanoseconds precision for pcapng files (thank you @akvinikym !)
   - Enable `flush` for pcap and pcapng file writers (thank you @rickyzhang82 and @l-henken !)
 - TCP reassembly returns status in every call to `TcpReassembly::reassemblePacket()` (thank you @starliiit !) 
 - Add port filter to HttpAnalyzer (thank you @makefriend8 !)
 - Support for setting snapshot length in PcapLiveDevice (thank you @wongsingfo !)
 - `GeneralFilter::matchPacketWithFilter()` can now match packet of any link layer (thank you @skorup101 !)
