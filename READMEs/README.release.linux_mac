This package contains:
----------------------

 - PcapPlusPlus compiled libraries
    - libCommon++.a
    - libPacket++.a
    - libPcap++.a
 - PcapPlusPlus header files (under header/)
 - Compiled examples (under examples/)
 - A makefile that should be included when compiling your app with PcapPlusPlus (mk/PcapPlusPlus.mk)
 - Code example with a simple Makefile showing how to build applications using PcapPlusPlus compiled binaries (under example-app/)


Running the examples:
---------------------
 - Make sure you have libpcap installed (should come built-in with most Linux and Mac OS X distributions)
 - In Linux you may need to run the executables as sudo


In order to compile your application with these binaries you need to:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Make sure you have libpcap developer pack installed (in Ubuntu: install it using apt-get: "sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev"; in Mac OS X it should come with Xcode)
 - Make sure the binaries matches your OS (for example: pcapplusplus-17.02-ubuntu-12.04-x86-64-gcc-4.6.tar.gz pack probably won't work well in Ubuntu 14.04)
 - Make sure your gcc/g++ version matches the compiled binaries version (for example: pcapplusplus-17.02-ubuntu-12.04-x86-64-gcc-4.6.tar.gz pack probably won't work well with gcc 4.8)
 - Update mk/PcapPlusPlus.mk file:
     - Set "PCAPPLUSPLUS_HOME" to the folder where binaries are located
 - Include mk/PcapPlusPlus.mk in your Makefile and add PcapPlusPlus includes, libs, etc. to your Makefile 
     - You can follow the example under example-app/
     - Or follow "Writing Applications With PcapPlusPlus" section in http://seladb.github.io/PcapPlusPlus-Doc/examples.html
